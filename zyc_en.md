I'm one of the generals of the peasant uprising army in the late Ming Dynasty. Next, let's see my story



Cause trouble

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no documentary record of my resume before the incident, and there are many contradictions in the records of the days of the incident and surrender.



First, according to Ji Liuqi's northern strategy of the Ming Dynasty, there are no more than six kinds of rogue soldiers: traitors, fugitives, post soldiers, Xiangma, hungry people and refugees. In the first year of Chongzhen (1628),



In Fulin village, Chang'an County, Xi'an Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, a rich family held the power to bully. Qian Wenjun, a local rich family, lent usury to the garrison, set the date of salary payment, sent evil servants to collect debts, beat debtors and robbed money and food.



The soldiers in debt were angry and gathered to fight back, almost killing the evil servant. Qian Wenjun bribed county officials and severely punished the soldiers involved. The intervention of the military chief was invalid. Feeling that the county officials were unfair, the soldiers simply robbed the prison, exterminated Qian Wenjun's family and wantonly killed and plundered them.



Although there were only a few hundred soldiers in disorder, a large number of refugees were attached to them and gradually became tens of thousands. They recommended brave and talented people as leaders, including Gao Yingxiang and Zhang Xianzhong,



I was also the person who was elected. I called myself the "land sweeper", attached to Zhang Xianzhong, and sent the peasant army to Shandong to fight

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the other hand, according to the chronicles of the Ming Dynasty written by Gu Yingtai, on June 1, the fourth year of Chongzhen (June 29, 1631), Cao Wenzhao killed Wang Jiayin in Yangcheng. The rest of the party elected another leader, Wang Jiayin, for their own use, and the party members took their own names,



I'm one of them. I'm called the "sweeping king". I'm one of the 36 battalions of peasant rebels.

===============================================================================

March

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

That year, in the sixth year of Chongzhen (1633), Gao Yingxiang's army attacked the land of Chu. Governor Deng Zuyu firmly guarded the city, and the "land sweeper", that is, I, "mixed king" Zhang Yingjin and other nine generals besieged it,



Captured, the peasant army persuaded him to surrender, Deng Zuyu angrily scolded and unyielding, cut his heart and gouged out his liver and died [5]. October 10, the seventh year of Chongzhen (November 30, 1634),



On January 29, 2009 (March 17, 1635), Zhang Yi and I attacked the area north of the Yangtze River and divided the troops into two groups. They came out from Yingshan and Huoshan, passing over the buried hill, Taihu Lake and Susong,



After the capture of Chenzhou and Lingbao, Zhao Shiyan, the county magistrate of buried hill, was seriously injured and died, and Jin YingYuan and Hu Yongning, the county magistrate of Taihu Lake, were killed. Because these areas are mountainous and there are still many hunters, they are often equipped with bows and crossbows,



Jiezhai attacked and killed, the peasant army was defeated and expelled by the mountain people, so they surrounded Macheng to the West and arrived at Hankou. On January 15, the eighth year of Chongzhen (March 3, 1635),



Zhang Yichuan and his team entered Yingzhou with Zhang Xianzhong and attacked Fengyang. Fengyang had no walls and the officers and soldiers fled without fighting. Burn the Ming imperial mausoleum, burn 300000 pine trees, and kill more than 60 eunuchs guarding the mausoleum,



Release more than 100 people who committed crimes against the high wall. I have all my share. Later, King Taiping and I went to Fengyang government to release the prisoners. Yan Rongxuan, the governor, dressed in prison clothes and pretended to be a prisoner, was found out, so I



Wait for Zhang Gu to rise in the court and kill Yan Rongxuan with a staff [8]. In the same year, he led 10000 people to attack Qi County, and many earth walls collapsed. Shen Jiayin, the magistrate of Qi County, recruited the dead and defeated Zhang Yichuan [9].

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the first month of the ninth year of Chongzhen (February 1636), Wang ziyong and I met with the old Department, and Li Zicheng and other twenty-four battalions failed to attack Xuzhou, so we went west to capture Yucheng and entered Henan.



Liu Xiaoshan, the "king of the word", Luo Rucai, the "Cao Cao", Zhang Yichuan, the "sweeping king", and other five battalion troops approached Kaifeng from guide to shijialou. January 25 (March 2, 1636),



The Ming Dynasty sneaked Zu Dale into guide, set up ambushes, and lured the peasant army to attack with a small number of soldiers. The lured soldiers met the peasant army in the snow garden, pretended to be defeated and went to guide. The peasant army tried to catch up,



Zu Dale played drums and raised his flag. The East and West wings highlighted the Ming army. Three bread copied, the peasant army was defeated, beheaded more than 1400 levels, and the peasant army was divided into two, one to Junzhou and one to Sichuan

===============================================================================

Jiangming

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When and how I came to Ming Dynasty are vague. There are even claims that Zuo Liangyu, Chen Yongfu and Zhao Guozhu were killed in yingyu before Ming Dynasty.



"Records of officials who died in the imperial court" indicates the 12th year of Chongzhen (1639), and "northern strategy of the Ming Dynasty" indicates the 13th year of Chongzhen (1640). Zhang Yichuan attached to the heavenly star huideng phase,



After having a holiday with Zhang Xianzhong, huideng went to Xinning and said to the generals of the peasant army, "it's not my intention to be an itinerant bandit." The generals of the peasant army made a great uproar and gathered together to attack it. Huideng walked east in embarrassment and was determined to be incorporated into the organizational system,



So he surrendered to Zuo Liangyu. Yang Sichang ordered the generals Zhang Yichuan and Li Jing to be subordinate to the supervisor of the army. Dali right commented that Wan Yuanji belonged to him. October (October to November 1639 or November to December 1640),



I met Zhang Xianzhong in Zitong and was defeated and captured. Zhang Xianzhong hated his betrayal and delayed it. After my death, Wan Yuanji pitied my wife to Yiling

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the reign of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, in view of the fact that I was incorporated into the organizational system and met the peasant army, I died miserably, so I pursued the posthumous title of lieying, which became an example of a very few peasant army generals being affirmed by the feudal government.

This is my story. How about it?
