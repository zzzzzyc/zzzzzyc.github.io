I pursued the posthumous title of lieying during the reign of Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty



I'm one of the generals of the peasant uprising army in the late Ming Dynasty. Next, let's see my story



Cause trouble

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no documentary record of my resume before the incident, and there are many contradictions in the records of the days of the incident and surrender.



First, according to Ji Liuqi's northern strategy of the Ming Dynasty, there are no more than six kinds of rogue soldiers: traitors, fugitives, post soldiers, Xiangma, hungry people and refugees. In the first year of Chongzhen (1628),



In Fulin village, Chang'an County, Xi'an Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, a rich family held the power to bully. Qian Wenjun, a local rich family, lent usury to the garrison, set the date of salary payment, sent evil servants to collect debts, beat debtors and robbed money and food.



The soldiers in debt were angry and gathered to fight back, almost killing the evil servant. Qian Wenjun bribed county officials and severely punished the soldiers involved. The intervention of the military chief was invalid. Feeling that the county officials were unfair, the soldiers simply robbed the prison, exterminated Qian Wenjun's family and wantonly killed and plundered them.



Although there were only a few hundred soldiers in disorder, a large number of refugees were attached to them and gradually became tens of thousands. They recommended brave and talented people as leaders, including Gao Yingxiang and Zhang Xianzhong,



I was also the person who was elected. I called myself the "land sweeper", attached to Zhang Xianzhong, and sent the peasant army to Shandong to fight

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the other hand, according to the chronicles of the Ming Dynasty written by Gu Yingtai, on June 1, the fourth year of Chongzhen (June 29, 1631), Cao Wenzhao killed Wang Jiayin in Yangcheng. The rest of the party elected another leader, Wang Jiayin, for their own use, and the party members took their own names,



I'm one of them. I'm called the "sweeping king". I'm one of the 36 battalions of peasant rebels.

===============================================================================

March

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

That year, in the sixth year of Chongzhen (1633), Gao Yingxiang's army attacked the land of Chu. Governor Deng Zuyu firmly guarded the city, and the "land sweeper", that is, I, "mixed king" Zhang Yingjin and other nine generals besieged it,



Captured, the peasant army persuaded him to surrender, Deng Zuyu angrily scolded and unyielding, cut his heart and gouged out his liver and died [5]. October 10, the seventh year of Chongzhen (November 30, 1634),



On January 29, 2009 (March 17, 1635), Zhang Yi and I attacked the area north of the Yangtze River and divided the troops into two groups. They came out from Yingshan and Huoshan, passing over the buried hill, Taihu Lake and Susong,



After the capture of Chenzhou and Lingbao, Zhao Shiyan, the county magistrate of buried hill, was seriously injured and died, and Jin YingYuan and Hu Yongning, the county magistrate of Taihu Lake, were killed. Because these areas are mountainous and there are still many hunters, they are often equipped with bows and crossbows,



Jiezhai attacked and killed, the peasant army was defeated and expelled by the mountain people, so they surrounded Macheng to the West and arrived at Hankou. On January 15, the eighth year of Chongzhen (March 3, 1635),



Zhang Yichuan and his team entered Yingzhou with Zhang Xianzhong and attacked Fengyang. Fengyang had no walls and the officers and soldiers fled without fighting. Burn the Ming imperial mausoleum, burn 300000 pine trees, and kill more than 60 eunuchs guarding the mausoleum,



Release more than 100 people who committed crimes against the high wall. I have all my share. Later, King Taiping and I went to Fengyang government to release the prisoners. Yan Rongxuan, the governor, dressed in prison clothes and pretended to be a prisoner, was found out, so I



Wait for Zhang Gu to rise in the court and kill Yan Rongxuan with a staff [8]. In the same year, he led 10000 people to attack Qi County, and many earth walls collapsed. Shen Jiayin, the magistrate of Qi County, recruited the dead and defeated Zhang Yichuan [9].

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the first month of the ninth year of Chongzhen (February 1636), Wang ziyong and I met with the old Department, and Li Zicheng and other twenty-four battalions failed to attack Xuzhou, so we went west to capture Yucheng and entered Henan.



Liu Xiaoshan, the "king of the word", Luo Rucai, the "Cao Cao", Zhang Yichuan, the "sweeping king", and other five battalion troops approached Kaifeng from guide to shijialou. January 25 (March 2, 1636),



The Ming Dynasty sneaked Zu Dale into guide, set up ambushes, and lured the peasant army to attack with a small number of soldiers. The lured soldiers met the peasant army in the snow garden, pretended to be defeated and went to guide. The peasant army tried to catch up,



Zu Dale played drums and raised his flag. The East and West wings highlighted the Ming army. Three bread copied, the peasant army was defeated, beheaded more than 1400 levels, and the peasant army was divided into two, one to Junzhou and one to Sichuan

===============================================================================

Jiangming

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When and how I came to Ming Dynasty are vague. There are even claims that Zuo Liangyu, Chen Yongfu and Zhao Guozhu were killed in yingyu before Ming Dynasty.



"Records of officials who died in the imperial court" indicates the 12th year of Chongzhen (1639), and "northern strategy of the Ming Dynasty" indicates the 13th year of Chongzhen (1640). Zhang Yichuan attached to the heavenly star huideng phase,



After having a holiday with Zhang Xianzhong, huideng went to Xinning and said to the generals of the peasant army, "it's not my intention to be an itinerant bandit." The generals of the peasant army made a great uproar and gathered together to attack it. Huideng walked east in embarrassment and was determined to be incorporated into the organizational system,



So he surrendered to Zuo Liangyu. Yang Sichang ordered the generals Zhang Yichuan and Li Jing to be subordinate to the supervisor of the army. Dali right commented that Wan Yuanji belonged to him. October (October to November 1639 or November to December 1640),



I met Zhang Xianzhong in Zitong and was defeated and captured. Zhang Xianzhong hated his betrayal and delayed it. After my death, Wan Yuanji pitied my wife to Yiling

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the reign of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, in view of the fact that I was incorporated into the organizational system and met the peasant army, I died miserably, so I pursued the posthumous title of lieying, which became an example of a very few peasant army generals being affirmed by the feudal government.

This is my story. How about it?



Next, I'll show you another paragraph

Biography of Zhang Yichuan

I've wanted to write about Zhang Yichuan for a long time. However, the materials are not comprehensive enough. Today, April 15, 2022, I think I have collected enough materials, so I began to write the biography of Zhang Yichuan.

1、 Zhang Yichuan's life experience

thank: https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Zhang Yichuan, northern strategy of Ming Dynasty, records of officials who won the imperial court and died in the festival, records of exiled bandits, the history of the Ming Dynasty, the history of the Ming Dynasty, etc.

。。。。。。。

The content here is repeated and has been omitted

。。。。。。。

Because Zhang Yichuan died in October 1639, November 1639, November 1640 and December 1640, Zhang Yichuan is a superposition of life and death. He lived and died from October 1639 to December 1640, which is really "Schrodinger's Zhang Yichuan".

2、 Zhang Yichuan's life experience

Thanks: Zhang Yichuan, inverting the space, etc.

Zhang Yichuan (January, 2010 or 2011).

He is a person from China - Beijing - Haidian District - Wanshou Road School District - Taiping Road Street - Beijing Jianhua Experimental School - teaching building - Primary School Department - second floor - fifth grade - class 3 - first row - fifth column. His home address is Room 301, floor 3, unit 7, building 39, laoshanxili, Haidian District, Beijing, China. His name is Zhang Yichuan.

4、 Zhang Yichuan's class website

Thank you: reverse the space, Zhang Yichuan, etc.

Zhang Yichuan has a class website, which is http://bjjjh201703.com 。 This is in Fanke service, and after careful study, I found that Zhang Yichuan is not simple.

Beijing Unicom 100m broadband Ping bjjh201703 com：

Ping statistics of 36.255.222.24:

Packet: sent = 137, received = 124, lost = 13 (9% lost),

Estimated round trip time in milliseconds:

Shortest = 40ms, longest = 58ms, average = 44ms

No wonder sometimes access is slow.

http://bjjh201703.com/ No SSL certificate!

The home page is written in blue with "three shifts", and on the right is a release link of a warehouse in GitHub. If you click that link, you will not enter GitHub, but refresh it http://bjjjh201703.com , you click the left mouse button, click the link and drag it to the tab. As a result, it refreshes again before you finish http://bjjjh201703.com , really traitor, brush the number of hits. What kind of advertising blocker is the link of a release in a warehouse of GitHub? I don't know what use Zhang Yichuan has for it.

Fanke's advertisement is on the home page, which is quite unfriendly to the touch screen. Don't care about these details, keep looking. The picture on the home page is a group photo of class 3, grade 5 in Lantian city (I don't know where it is). Click the left and right buttons, and there is a link to "teacher Pan's Baidu online disk".

Looking down, it says "go and see all the resources?", There's a key next to it. Click it and there's no response. A little more, still no response. You find a button called "button" in the hundreds of pixels below. Click it to have a look. I have to say, I'm convinced of this operation. I told Zhang Yichuan seven times and the answer was: (laughing)

Well, go and have a look. Here are 28 photos of class 3, grade 5. You can have a look at the photos from grade 1 (it's a real group photo) to grade 5. I feel from the bottom of my heart that the students in class 3, grade 5 are generous enough, and I don't care if the portrait right is infringed. Fortunately, I'm lucky. I'm not in class 3, grade 5, or I'll be mad. The three links of "teacher Pan's Baidu online disk" in front are all Baidu online disk sharing files with their group photos.

At the bottom of the home page is written that this website was established by Zhang Yichuan. At the bottom is Fanke's advertisement and several friend chains. First: home page http://bjjh201703.com ； Second: About http://bjjh201703.com/col.jsp?id=101 ； Third: picture http://bjjh201703.com/col.jsp?id=105 , is "go and have a look"; Fourth: contact us http://bjjh201703.com/col.jsp?id=102 ； Fifth: Zhangdian https://zzzzzyc-1.mallfkw.cn/ ； Sixth: customer service http://bjjh201703.com/col.jsp?id=121 。；

The second is about（ http://bjjh201703.com/col.jsp?id=101 ）, there's bjjh201703 in it Com version and the location of his school and Zhang Yichuan's mobile number: + 86 15533983418. Hey, no, it's clearly Haidian District. I have to write Shunyi district. I told Zhang Yichuan five times and he said, "er... This..." it can be seen that his class website was built on March 7, 2022, just 100 days later than my website.

The personal website with inverted space has been running: 148 days, 15 hours, 3 minutes and 56 secondsThe third is the picture（ http://bjjh201703.com/col.jsp?id=105 ）, that's the pictures of "go and have a look", 28. The name of the picture on page 25 is misspelled. Page 28 is very interesting.

The fourth is to contact us（ http://bjjh201703.com/col.jsp?id=102 ）。 He wrote down his home address!!! Really can kill!! Zhang Yichuan's family lives in Room 301, floor 3, unit 7, building 39, laoshanxili, Haidian District, Beijing, China.

The fifth is Zhangdian（ https://zzzzzyc-1.mallfkw.cn ）。 His surname is Zhang, so he is Zhang Dian and Fanke's service. What "Zhang Yichuan takes pictures for you", one yuan a piece. I have a picture of Yichuan here. At 14:27 on April 20, 2022, I took it with more than 8000 cameras of Jiang hacker's parents in the school. Many, 15, including Zhang Yichuan's vertical middle finger. Link: https://musetransfer.com/s/top6xfono 。 Next, what one-stop service, boil bald skin, 4999.99 yuan, a black heart merchant. Zhang Yichuan has no business license. That's it. It makes our class's "stewed eggs" laugh and almost roll. The remaining 30 yuan Zhang Yichuan will help you do the audio post, 1 yuan Zhang Yichuan will help you take photos (repeated), and the original price is 0 yuan and the current price is 5 yuan to donate to Zhang Yichuan. Finally, it reads: "the price is affordable, 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 Zhang Yichuan's wechat payment code and wechat payment bank card registered in the name of Zhang Yichuan's father Zhang Yu are on the product details page of Zhang Dian.

The students in our class registered an account at about 12 noon on April 21, 2022. The customer account name of Zhangdian is 666666, the password is 888888, the mobile phone number is the real mobile phone number of the marinated egg, and the email is the real email of the marinated egg: xiaohuiyuan@126.com , the message is 54188. As a result, Zhang Yichuan changed the account name to (the dirty word of a certain word is the full name of the national top-level domain name of Solomon Islands) and the password to 54188

Zhang Yichuan's website is analyzed here first. Here comes the highlight: Zhang Yichuan.

5、 Zhang Yichuan

At this time, a strange picture suddenly flashed in my mind: in a room in old Shanxi, there were several computers attacking the website. In the meantime, an 11-year-old boy picked up his mobile phone, opened it and tried his best to look at a commodity, but the mobile phone told him to send a new email and ran away under his eyelids.

This young man is Zhang Yichuan. When I met him, I was only eleven and a half years old. It will be four weeks from now. That day, I saw him in the corridor. At this glance, I saw a fat fifth grader with a USB flash drive copying viruses in the public computer in the school corridor; There are many viruses, and they are also very particular. There are many onlookers, and people should be prevented from taking the documents. I think it's interesting to ask the little fat man where he got the virus, and he told me that he bought it from the hacker information he spent dozens of yuan on the evening of the spell. I find it more and more funny that some people buy viruses from the sunset. They catch a lot of viruses online, which are free. I thought the little fat man was a little silly, so he spread the virus to the Internet disk, and finally whored at home that night. Later, I saw him appreciate his class website and thought he was unusual.

I found that the little fat man also took physical exercise at 6:30 in the morning. So did I. So I asked him in the physical exercise class, "what's your name? Why do you have to spell the sunset to buy a virus?" It happened to be a rest, and the teacher allowed it; I am also very happy, because I have heard the name of Zhang Yichuan for a long time, and know that he is as old as me. He was born in April, and his father's surname is Zhang, so his name is Zhang Yichuan.

So I look forward to exercise every day. Exercise comes every day, and Zhang Yichuan comes every day. It's easy for me to fly to the track the next day. He is running, to be exact, walking. He was the only one in his class who took part in morning exercise. It was easy for him to expect someone to chat with him, so we knew each other in less than half an hour. He has a deep research on computers, robots and spending money. I can't compare with him.

We didn't know what to talk about at that time. I just remember that I was very happy to meet such a strange person after primary school.

The next minute, I will talk to him about computer and his website. He said:
